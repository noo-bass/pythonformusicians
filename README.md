The idea of writing a book on python for musicians is bizarre. Most musicians try their hardest to avoid ever having to write a line of code in their lives. But the approach of AI prompted me (pardon the pun) to think differently about music, computers and code. And more importantly how the three can come together.

A new generation of composition is coming and it isn't written in notation. It's written in python.

What this book aims to take you from "I thought a python was a snake" to training an AI music model without you getting bored. To avoid the boredom it is structured through a series of projects. You will be making sounds and experimenting from day one, my hope is that the python knowledge and wider knowledge of computational principles will arrive as we go.
